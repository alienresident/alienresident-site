## Welcome


I'm Mark Reilly, a User Experience Designer with 18 years of digital experience. I'm the Associate Director of User Experience at [KBS](http://www.kbsagency.com/) an agency in NYC: working on the BMW, Hershey, and Stanley Black & Decker accounts. Before joining the agency, I worked at Thirteen, Scholastic, Columbia University, and New York University. 

This site was first designed in 2000 and has had a number of redesigns. It now functions as [an archive of some of my work](design/ "View my design archive"). I've design and built a wide variety of websites over the years. I was deeply involved in the local NYC Drupal community for 5+ years. I have been focussing on UX for the last 6 years. I still get to use my developer skills by building prototypes instead of production sites.
